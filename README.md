# SurfRockaway

Simple ruby based CLI application to pull a surf report for Rockaway Beach, Queens, NY.

## Installation

```
$ gem install surf-rockaway
```

## Detailed Description

A Florida native, moving to NYC over the summer left me longing for the beach. I soon discovered Rockaway Beach is the closest surf spot to the city. (bonus you can take the water ferry!) All too often, I found myself lost in a terminal screen ... searching for an excuse to hit the beach for a few hours. So, I created surf-rockaway. This gem provides a quick way to check the current surf condtions without ever leaving the terminal.

## Data Provided

--- current forecast
--- 3-day surf conditions
--- (in development) Set notification based on wave size

## Development

After checking out the repo, run bin/setup to install dependencies. You can also run bin/console for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run bundle exec rake install. To release a new version, update the version number in version.rb and then run bundle exec rake release, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the .gem file to rubygems.org.
