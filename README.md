# surf-rockaway

// quick summary

Simple ruby based CLI application to pull a surf report for Rockaway Beach, Queens, NY.

// detailed description

A Florida native for most of my life, moving to NYC over the summer left me longing for the beach. I soon discovered Rockaway Beach is the closest surf spot to the city. (bonus you can take the water ferry!) All too often, I found myself lost in a terminal screen ... searching for an excuse to hit the beach for a few hours. So, I created surf-rockaway. This gem provides a quick way to check the current surf condtions without ever leaving the terminal.
